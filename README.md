# ftp-delete-action
Automate deleting files on your ftp server using this GitHub action.

Useful for cleaning up logs/tempfiles or removing files that are autogenerated with a new name for each build. For example `precache-manifest.*.js` in a ReactJS build.  


This action is inspired by https://github.com/sebastianpopp/ftp-action which is used to automate the ftp copy process.  

The example below uses GitHub secrets to generate the parameters you don't want to have visible in your repo: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets  

## Example usage

```

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repo

        remoteDirectories: "/App_Data/TEMP"
